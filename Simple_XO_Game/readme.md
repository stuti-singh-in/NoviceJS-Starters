This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe (XO) game using JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid. The first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with their symbol wins the game. If all the cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

Features:

Interactive gameplay with mouse clicks to place X and O symbols on the board.
Real-time updates on the game status, including player turns and win/draw outcomes.
Restart button to reset the game and start a new match.
How to Play:

Open the game in your web browser.
Click on the empty cells in the grid to place your symbol (X or O) during your turn.
The game will automatically check for a win or draw condition after each move.
If a player wins or the game ends in a draw, a message will be displayed, and the game can be restarted.
Try it out and have fun playing the classic XO game!
